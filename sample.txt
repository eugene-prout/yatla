This is the starter template.

This line contains a {{ slot }}.

Slots can also contain mathematical expressions: {{ 3 + factor * 7 }}.
With full support for operator precedence: {{ (3 + factor) * 7 }}.

Foreach loops are also valid. For example:

This is the {{ factor }} times table:
{{ foreach num in num_list }}
    {{ factor }} * {{ num }} = {{ factor * num }}
{{ endforeach }}
